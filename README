This game was created for my SYSC 1102 class. You can see the details of the game at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice)

"Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e. the turn total). At any time during a player's turn, the player is faced with two options:

roll - If the player rolls a:

1: the player scores nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
2 - 6: the number is added to the player's turn total and the player's turn continues.

hold - The turn total is added to the player's score and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins."
